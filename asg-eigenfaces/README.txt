Eigenface.py : Starts an interactive tool as presented in the lecture.

helper.py : helper functions used by Eigenface.py and asg.py. You should not change this file, we will use the unmodified version for testing.

asg.py : here you need to work.



Notes:

Before running this program successfully you need to download a file containing all images (we didn't want to put them all in your individual repositories). You have two options:

1.) (recommended) Please download the file 'https://imada.sdu.dk/~daniel/DM561-DM562-images/images.p' and put it in the current directory, i.e.,  next to 'asg6.py' (do not change the filename). Then start the program again.

2.) Uncomment the two lines in the code 'EigenFace.py' just below this print message and remove the 'sys.exit()'. This will automatically download the necessary file for you.


The downloaded file 'images.p' has a size of 77423721 bytes and the md5 hash is 0184581eb1a8d94f20bb1c44a5e3ec45. For the final grading we might use another set of images. 

!!! DO NOT PUSH image.p TO THE REPOSITORY !!!
